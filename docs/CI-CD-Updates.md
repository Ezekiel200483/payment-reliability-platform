# CI/CD Pipeline Adjustments - Post Terraform Removal

## Summary of Changes

After the deletion of the terraform folder, the CI/CD pipeline has been updated to work with the current Docker Compose-based infrastructure setup.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Infrastructure Validation Job Replacement
- **Before**: `infrastructure` job that validated Terraform configurations
- **After**: `docker-validation` job that validates Docker Compose configurations
- **New Steps**:
  - Validates `docker-compose.yml` syntax
  - Pulls and builds Docker images
  - Ensures services are properly configured

#### 2. Deployment Strategy Update
- **Before**: Kubernetes-based deployments with Argo Rollouts and AWS EKS
- **After**: Docker Compose-based deployments for staging and production
- **Changes**:
  - Removed AWS credentials and kubectl configurations
  - Updated to use Docker Compose for service orchestration
  - Simplified deployment process for local/containerized environments

#### 3. Monitoring and Health Checks
- **Enhanced smoke tests**: Created comprehensive test scripts
- **Production health checks**: Added detailed monitoring validation
- **Metrics validation**: Ensures Prometheus and Grafana are operational

#### 4. New Files Created

##### Testing Scripts
- `testing/smoke-tests.sh`: Basic health checks for staging deployments
- `testing/production-smoke-tests.sh`: Comprehensive production health validation
- `scripts/check-deployment-health.py`: Python script for detailed health monitoring

##### Key Features of New Scripts
- **Smoke Tests**: Validate API endpoints, health checks, and basic functionality
- **Production Tests**: Comprehensive checks including monitoring stack validation
- **Health Monitoring**: Performance baseline checks and detailed error reporting

#### 5. Pipeline Dependencies Updated
- Removed dependency on non-existent `infrastructure` job
- Updated job dependencies to use `docker-validation` instead
- Maintained proper deployment flow: `code-quality` → `test` → `build` → `deploy`

#### 6. Simplified Notification System
- Removed Slack webhook dependencies (can be re-added with proper secrets)
- Added basic logging and artifact uploads for deployment tracking
- Simplified error handling and rollback procedures

```

### Benefits of Updated Pipeline

1. **Simplified Infrastructure**: No longer dependent on cloud-specific resources
2. **Faster Deployments**: Docker Compose deployments are quicker than Kubernetes
3. **Better Local Development**: Aligns with local development workflow
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Enhanced smoke tests and health checks
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to understand and modify for team members

### Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Environment Secrets**: Add necessary secrets for production deployments
2. **Monitoring Integration**: Configure external monitoring if needed
3. **Security Scanning**: Ensure container security scanning is working properly
4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish performance thresholds based on actual usage
5. **Rollback Testing**: Test rollback procedures in staging environment

### Notes

- The pipeline now works entirely with Docker Compose
- All Terraform and Kubernetes references have been removed
- Scripts are executable and ready for use
- Environment variables can be configured per deployment stage
- Manual approval gates are maintained for production deployments
